# YT-hero-HAL
Hero header for YT video content.

I created this for use in HAL's landing pages.
The idea was to include a play button and once hit, the hero would load a YT player. The goal was to transform the hero container, and load the video player within the container with the brand blue on the sides.

The video player itself is ADA compliant and can be controlled solely by keyboard shortcuts.
Background image and YT ID can be changed within html file.
